       <h1>Rails is made of people</h1>
       <p>Ruby on Rails is for everyone who wants to build web applications, whether they're 30-year veterans or only just started to learn yesterday. All are welcome!

You can meet the community online on the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails"> Ruby on Rails Discussions or the the Ruby on Rails StackOverflow Q&A tag.</a> We also do a yearly<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails"> RailsConf conference for people to meet in real life.</a>  </p>
      
<h2>The core team</h2>
<p>The direction of the framework is being stewarded by the Rails core team. This group of long-term contributors manage releases, evaluate pull-requests, handle conduct complaints, and does a lot of the groundwork on major new features.</p>
<h3>The committer team</h3>
<p>In addition to the core team, we also have a committer team that assists with processing pull-requests and making changes to the framework, but does not have the keys to make final releases or set policy. All members of the core team came up through working on this team.</p>
